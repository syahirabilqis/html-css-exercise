    <p><b>The iPhone 5c</b>, simply put, is for those who've grown numb to Apple's largely evolutionary
        takes on its primary iPhone range. It'll attract a younger audience that cares less about finely
        beveled edges and more about playing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-09-10-iphone-5s-and-5c-cases.html"> <em>Connect</em> 4 on their iPhone case </a>. It'll cater to the same
        <i style="color:#49d100;"> crowd that has looked </i> longingly towards the $599 (again, off-contract) <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-08-05-motorola-moto-x-review.html"> Moto X </a>-- a phone for the
        mainstream, and a phone that's as colorful as one's soul. In a way, this is the anti-Moto X. From a
        price, spec and feature perspective, it's a match that's too close to call. The iPhone 5c's camera
        <a style="color:#ff0000;">has</a> an edge on the <b style="color: #ff0000;">Moto X</b>, but the X's Active Display is a boon for notifications. As these things
        tend to go, a lot of it boils down to ecosystem preference. The iPhone 5c is being built for the 
        same audience as the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2010-09-07-ipod-nano-review-2010.html">flashy iPod nano</a>, and moreover, Apple built it for those on Wall Street
        who feel that it simply <i> must </i> attract new markets to stay atop its game.</p>
    <hr style="border: 1px solid black;">
    <p>Apple never showed intentions of racing the <b><u>Nexus 7</u></b> to the bottom in the tablet game, and the 
    <b><i>iPhone 5c</i></b> is proof that it won't do that in the phone arena, either.</p>
